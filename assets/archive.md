# Online platforms for analytics
* [This article discusses some of the available platforms](https://medium.com/pangeo/cloud-native-geoprocessing-of-earth-observation-satellite-data-with-pangeo-997692d91ca2)
* [Pangeo](http://pangeo.io/index.html) -> There is no single software package called “pangeo”; rather, the Pangeo project serves as a coordination point between scientists, software, and computing infrastructure. Includes open source resources for parallel processing using Dask and Xarray. Pangeo recently announced their 2.0 goals: pivoting away from directly operating cloud-based JupyterHubs, and towards eductaion and research
* [Descartes Labs](https://www.descarteslabs.com/) -> access to EO imagery from a variety of providers via python API
* Planet have a [Jupyter notebook platform](https://developers.planet.com/) which can be deployed locally.
* [eurodatacube.com](https://eurodatacube.com/) -> data & platform for EO analytics in Jupyter env, paid
* [up42](https://up42.com/) is a developer platform and marketplace, offering all the building blocks for powerful, scalable geospatial products
* [Microsoft Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/) -> direct Google Earth Engine competitor in the making?
* [eofactory.ai](https://eofactory.ai/) -> supports multi public and private data sources that can be used to analyse and extract information
* [mapflow.ai](https://mapflow.ai/) -> imagery analysis platform with its instant access to the major satellite imagery providers, models for extract building footprints etc & [QGIS plugin](https://www.gislounge.com/run-ai-mapping-in-qgis-over-high-resolution-satellite-imagery/)
* [openeo](https://openeo.cloud/) by ESA data platform
* [Adam platform](https://adamplatform.eu/) -> the Advanced geospatial Data Management platform (ADAM) is a tool to access a large variety and volume of global environmental data
